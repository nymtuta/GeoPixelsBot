# GeoPixelsBot
A bot for the website https://geopixels.net

# Usage
1. Place a ghost of the image you want to paint using the [website](https://geopixels.net)'s ghost tool
2. Paste [ghostBot.js](ghostBot.js) in the browser console (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Use `startGhostBot()` to start the bot and `stopGhostBot()` to stop it
4. Zoom in a way you can see the whole ghost image and leave it that way (this is important or it will place pixels at the same place multiple times) (will be fixed later)
